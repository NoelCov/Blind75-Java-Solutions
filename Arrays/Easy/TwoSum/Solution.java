// Question link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

// This solution uses a hashmap to store the numbers that we've encountered so far.
// In case we need them in the future.

// Note: In leetcode one of the assumptions was that you will always get at least 1 result
// that's why I didn't include anything to check if the input was empty or things like that.

// Time complexity O(n)
// Space complexity O(n)
