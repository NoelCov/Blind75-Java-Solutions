# Blind 75 solutions in Java

## Intro

Hello all, this is a repository where I will be adding my solutions to the famous leetcode blind 75 list. My goal is to eventually complete it. I'm currently doing one problem a day and so I will most likely be pushing daily.

## Resources
Here I will put some of the resources I'm using to practice and solve this problems:

- [Neetcode - To find the collection of questions as well as video explanations](https://neetcode.io/practice)

- [Algorithms (4th edition) book (amazon link)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/032157351X?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)

- [Coding repo university (An amazing repo that has hundreds of resources to master the coding interview)](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
